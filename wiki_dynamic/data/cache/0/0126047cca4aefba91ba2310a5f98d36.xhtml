<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Full disclosure: I am one of the developers of Agilito @Pete Boon: I use it every day, so my experience counters yours, but if you would care to outline which pressing features you miss I&#039;d be happy to look them over. Feel free to add feature requests at <a href="http://agilito.googlecode.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://agilito.googlecode.com/"  rel="nofollow">http://agilito.googlecode.com/</a>. As the review stands, it is neither helpful nor informational, neither for us developers or for prospective users. @UserStories: it would be great if there was a way to respond to reviews without opening a 2nd account, or at least a way to contact reviewers. I&#039;m rating it a &#039;5&#039; because I can&#039;t submit a blank rating, and I don&#039;t want to unfairly skew the ratings, but I&#039;m not going to rate my own product (which I think is the best of the open source tools available) a 1.
