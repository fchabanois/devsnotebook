<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I use a physical Scrum board with post-its. Benefits are the simplicity and visibility, drawbacks are if you need the scrum board in a conference room.  For product backlog we use excel. Benefits are simplicity and that it is widepsread, drawbacks are that you need to create your own backlg template. The sprint backlog is seen both in the product backlog and on the physical scrum board. (LinkedIn3) </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We use excel templates for planning, sprint bl and product bl. Getting along with the templates is hard for some… It must be simple enougt to use in meetings but complex enough to be a good tool for planning and follow up. (LinkedIn3) </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> quickly…here&#039;s a short list… Rally, planning poker, <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> excel, Google docs (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Here&#039;s what I used and why. <strong><acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Project</strong> : I was young and foolish. <strong><acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Excel</strong> : It&#039;s like duct-tape for corporate life…light-weight, strong, and flexible. <strong>VersionOne</strong> : It was a nice Agile tool and the company I worked at (Intel) had licenses for it. <strong>RTC [Rational Team Concert]</strong> : Someone at my corporation had recently purchased licenses for it… (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We use as few tools as possible. Tools just gets in the way of getting anything done. We use a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Docs depending on whether the team is colocated or dispersed) for the product backlog and record cards attached to a whiteboard using blu-tac (or, again, using Google Docs if the team is dispersed). If there&#039;s no whiteboard available we just use sticky notes, sometimes with an extra strip of tape, attached directly to the wall. Nothing fancy at all, but it doesn&#039;t get in the way and it&#039;s immediately obvious to everybody. (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Currently we only use a task board and excel (for the burndown chart) because the team is co-located. We are adding a member to the team who is remote and we will use Jira Greenhopper so that we have a virtual task board. The decision about what tools to use was left for the team to make. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I used Scrumworks mostly which is good to allow distributed team keep track of the essentials whenever they like. It can be a bit fiddly and unintuitive in places though. Excel is useful when dev effort is part of wider organisational project. It is more <strong>user friendly</strong> for non-dev resources and for reporting upstairs. (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For one larger Scrum setup with 50 people and 6 Scrum teams, located physically in the same building: <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Project for the product backlog; Excel spreadsheet for the sprint backlog, created from scratch through a template at each planning workshop. (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For a team distributed over three continents (America, Europe and Asia): Excel spreadshet containing both product and sprint backlog, with some easy feauteres to mark what sprint a story/task belongs to. It only worked using the shared workbook feature because the teams <strong>shared the file system</strong>. Now I&#039;m currently setting up Scrum for a number of teams distributed in two European companies not (easily) sharing the same filesystem - and are inclined to use the same template but converted to Google Spreadsheet. Anyway, my company is using GoogleDocs as Office system. (LinkedIn3)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> honestly, excel works great. Microsoft Products come on most PC&#039;s so no cost to you. (LinkedIn2)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Just to balance this - strongly consider the cheapest and most flexible tool for tracking Scrum projects: Paper, post-its and white boards. Add in excel for charting / an electronic record and you have one of the most AGILE, flexible tools for Scrum tracking that there is. I&#039;m serious! Most tools will hamper your ability to inspect and adapt how you track, and sometimes how you work… (LinkedIn2)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> At a previous position we started off with a SCRUM board to get used to the process of Agile as well <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> Excel spreadsheets that we customized with our own formulas tailored to fit our specific needs for our system. We used this to manage the <strong>daily scrum, story points, the retrospectives at the end of the iteration as well as the metrics and burn down charts</strong>. Using the basics (SCRUM board and Excel) allowed us to <strong>identify patterns</strong> during our iteration so we were better able to manage them. I attended a Project Management Using Agile workshop and it was mentioned to <strong>start simple and then move into a tool that works best for you</strong>. That way you are still focused on the story points and tasks within the iteration and not trying to “keep up with the software.” The method of understanding the process before we put a tool in place really helped us. AgileZen.Com is an online tool that I&#039;ve heard a lot about. It is online based and has sort of a 37Signals vibe. I&#039;d be curious to know if any of you have heard of/used this.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I can&#039;t reiterate how crucial it is to find your process before you let a tool dictate it for you. Start with the basics: note cards, whiteboards, big visible charts, excel (if needed for tracking). Later on you can decide which tool will support how your team works best. I love how Mingle is flexible and seems to have a lot of good features, but it does require serious customization. <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When we first started out, we used a simple spreadsheet template we found online to manage our product backlogs, and our sprint backlogs.  The more we used Scrum, the more the spreadsheet grew in complexity to include time tracking by team member &amp; task, sprint dashboard reports, risk logs, impediment logs, and sprint retrospective notes.  As our projects became more complex, we needed to manage multiple release plans, multiple projects and multiple dispersed team members.  We tried using Microsoft SharePoint to manage our spreadsheets in a distributed environment, but it too became unmanageable. Quite simply, we reached the limit of what the spreadsheets were able to do for us.  Our scrummasters were spending far too much managing the spreadsheets. <em>(<a href="http://edgehopper.com/grab-bag-of-scrum-tools/" class="urlextern" title="http://edgehopper.com/grab-bag-of-scrum-tools/"  rel="nofollow">See the complete review of EdgeHopper</a>)</em></div>
