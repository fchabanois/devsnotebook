<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AgileBuddy, ProjectCards and Agilo probably make up the next grouping and all focus on the backlog management areas of the process. They don&#039;t provide much, if anything, in the way of story and task boards or burndown charts.   (edit : However, to clarify, Agilebuddy does contain a burndown chart in the app. There is also a screen cap of it on the Agilebuddy homepage named “Iteration Burndown”)<em>(<a href="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx" class="urlextern" title="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx"  rel="nofollow">see the detailed review here</a>)</em></div>
