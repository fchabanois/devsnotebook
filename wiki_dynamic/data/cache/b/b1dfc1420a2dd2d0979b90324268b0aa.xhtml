<li class="level1"><div class="li"> This is a GREAT tool and worth a try! I almost didn&#039;t evaluate BrightGreen, because it didn&#039;t have any previous feedback. I&#039;m VERY GLAD I decided to give due diligence to my evaluation and took a look at BrightGreen. Once you get into this tool it&#039;s <strong>very intuitive</strong> and easy to understand. I was able to get up and running in minutes. They EXCEL at <strong>support</strong> and the live chat feature is phenomenal. The <strong>product backlog and sprint planning</strong> features are very intuitive and easy to navigate. I understand they&#039;re updating some of the charts and the wall. This tool is DEFINITELY worth checking out. (userstories.com)</div>
