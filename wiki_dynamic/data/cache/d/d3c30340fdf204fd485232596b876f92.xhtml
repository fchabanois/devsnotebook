<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We tried RallyDev, VersionOne and Scrumworks. All of them are comprehensive tools but they they all took too long to set up and there were a lot of features we did not need. I went back to using Excel sheets as I was looking for something simple, till I came across ScrumEdge. ScrumEdge is really easy to set up and has its own built in scrum community where users can discuss their scrum related problems. All those who use excel sheets i would definitely recommend that you check out ScrumEdge. Best of all, there is a free plan available. <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>
