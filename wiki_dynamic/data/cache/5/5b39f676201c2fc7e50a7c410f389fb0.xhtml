<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Pierre, thanks for your post. I&#039;ve been looking for a free Scrum tool. I&#039;ve just downloaded, and started using ScrumDog. It seems to be more <strong>intuitive</strong> than many PAY for tools, and it&#039;s easy to use…. thanks again.. (LinkedIn3)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> (message from the editor)  Check out ScrumDog.com (  <a href="http://www.scrumdog.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.scrumdog.com"  rel="nofollow">http://www.scrumdog.com</a>  ). It&#039;s free and the simple interface makes it faster and easier to use than most other options, leaving more time to actually work on your project. The “Daily Questions” feature helps you organize your daily scrum meetings as well.  (LinkedIn2)</div>

Redmine has <acronym title="Lightweight Directory Access Protocol">LDAP</acronym> and it&#039;s free.
