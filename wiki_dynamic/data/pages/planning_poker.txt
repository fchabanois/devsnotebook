  - We tried to use planning poker for about a year, ultimately we converted (against our will) to calling 8 perfect man hours a single point, mostly because the big boss kept beating up our project managers about "WHEN" are you going to be "done." We have literally thousands of features and actually a handful of concurrent projects working asynchronously by a total of less than a dozen developers to get to a deliverable point. Poker might work for smaller sprints with larger teams and no deadlines. With larger sprints, with fewer developers, with cold hard deadlines, it was almost impossible to predict a fair date for the work that was prioritized and assigned to a sprint. (LinkedIn3)
