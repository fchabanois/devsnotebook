====== Redmine ======

  - Redmine (plugin: TaskBoard, BurnUp/BurnDown Chart). Planningpoker.com. Mamble or Skype. Enterprise Architect. Teamviewer.com. (LinkedIn3)
  -  Redmine has **LDAP** and it's **free**. I like'd Rally, but it is expansive and there is no LDAP. (LinkedIn3)
  - We are using the Redmine system, trunk version with the **Scrum dashboard** and subtasks plug-ins. Working nicely for **sprint management** and **bug tracking**. (LinkedIn2)
  -  We are using Redmine with our customized plugins for Burndown's, Sprints and Budget tracing. Works very nicely. We have also improved team planing/resource planing by developing our own Schedules plugin. There are also nice plugins for code reviewing. All open source based on RoR. I mostly appreciate it by customizing our own workflow which allowed us to move big part of our communication to one place.
