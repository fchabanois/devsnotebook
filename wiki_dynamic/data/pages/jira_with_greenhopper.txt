====== Jira with Greenhopper ======

  - Jira with Greenhopper works excellent. It is very flexible and has that scrum board feeling to it. I used to be a big fan of moving physical cards across a board, but this doesn't help if you have a **distributed team**. You also **lose out on a lot of stats**. Planning Poker is a must.

  - I agree with Mikael Brodd, and Shane O'Neil. The core elements - a physical board with post-its and planning poker are a must. For distributed teams, find a common time and use Skype or GoToMeeting to run the standups. Map the backlog, post-its etc to Jira with Greenhopper too, so that you can have the **stats**. It really boosts team moral to physically move a post-it to the "Done" column on the board.. even if its only the local team who actually sees it, also when the CEO walks new/potential customers through the company dev space he has something great to show and talk about.. (LinkedIn3)
  - Jira with Greenhopper is one of the best tools out there today IMHO. It's almost entirely **customizeable** to fit your specific project needs in addition to the good things others have said about it. (LinkedIn3)
  - Currently we only use a task board and excel (for the burndown chart) because the team is co-located. We are adding a member to the team who is remote and we will use Jira Greenhopper so that we have a virtual task board. The decision about what tools to use was left for the team to make. (LinkedIn3)
  - Jira/Greenhopper and Physical Boards. (LinkedIn3)
  - At one of the companies I worked at we used Agilo for a time, but ended up switching it out for Jira & Greenhopper. (http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/  ). Atlassian (who develops Jira) may still offer free licenses for Open Source projects (the product itself isn't open source though)  (LinkedIn2)
  - Jira is great for Scrum. It's not open source, but it is free to non-profits and open source projects. (LinkedIn2)
  - In my experience it is worth paying for commercial tools such as Atlassian Jira and Greenhopper. The licence costs will be insignificant compared to overall project costs and the 'peace of mind' factor of having a professional support contract should not be underestimated. (LinkedIn2)
  -  Same here: JIRA + GreenHopper and cork boards (no wonder as we work for Atlassian). To easily move from JIRA/GH to cork boards we use our own plugin (now available for purchase) - Agile Scrum Cards Print Plugin for JIRA (  https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/9601  ). We wrote this plugin specifically for ourselves (how to marry JIRA/GH and physical boards) and it turned out that people like it so we sell it. (LinkedIn3)
  - I have used Greenhopper where JIRA was already available. It requires just a little bit of customization to 2-3 fields in Jira to make the burndowns and estimates work as I expected. Overall, it worked very well. //([[http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&id=35760|mobi]])//

  - Personally, I found using greenhopper to be a massive waste of time. It did nothing but create administration work. You know team's worldview has been twisted up beyond recognition when the greenhopper fan on the team says "yes, we've still got 5 hours left but only 2 real ones(!)"... Honestly - index cards and a pen work better. //([[http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&id=35760|mobi]])//
