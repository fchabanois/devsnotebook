====== ScrumNinja ======
  - Simply the best project management tool I've used. (userstories.com)
  - SilverCatalyst and Scrumninja are similar concepts and, that they scored so similarly is not surprising. They don't do anywhere near as much as the upper tier tools in terms of allowing multiple levels of project, releases, iterations, epics, stories, tasks, tests etc. but they are no where near as complicated either. They do the core items very effectively and intuitively with a high focus on a familiar card based story/task board view of the project. //([[http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx|see the detailed review here]])//
