<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We use Microsoft Visual Studio Team System. You manage work items (PBI, SBI, Tasks, …) that can be managed with an Excel sheet from which you can <strong>publish your changes</strong> to the Team server. There is Scrum template that&#039;s very useful and comes with lots of <strong>reports</strong> out-of-the box. We still use a physical board in our war room. But you can see the same stuff electronically on the Team System.  Another very nice part about it is that developers use the same work items and when they check in their code, they put a <strong>status of resolved</strong> on the work item (User story). The tester then sees the status <strong>(get notified) and can test the functionality as soon as the automated build deploys to the test environment</strong>. You then have traceability from the code (changeset) back to the user story. I think it&#039;s great. (LinkedIn3)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Like Pascal, we also use Microsoft Visual Studio Team System. We use the Scrum template and the electronic Task Board from Conchango - neither of these are perfect, but they do help make VSTS very aligned to Scrum. In VSTS 2010 there are templates that are much more aligned to Scrum, so we may migrate to that and leave the Conchango stuff behind. (LinkedIn3)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Scrum for Team System has a nice free product. Not open source, but it is free and customizable (<a href="http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com"  rel="nofollow">www.scrumforteamsystem.com</a>) Also, it must be used in conjunction with a Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS). I use it on nearly every project, the actual project templates can be customized to suit the team /business dynamic. (LinkedIn2)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Combine this with Episerver&#039;s scrum dashboard and you have what you need. If you&#039;re already using Team system and need a digital tool for handling your backlogs, I would recommend using Scrum for Team system. The work item definitions are clear and really useful. The help website (<a href="http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com"  rel="nofollow">www.scrumforteamsystem.com</a>) gives you all the information you need. The only thing I really missed from start was a good dashboard which visualized the sprints. By installing EPISERVER&#039;s Scrum Dashboard from Codeplex, I had what I and the team needed.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I&#039;m piloting Scrum for Team System and it looks promising. They have a nice “Task Board” desktop app which gives a good view of the sprint and allows you to move virtual stickies from column to column (e.g. not started to in progress to ready for test to done). The process templates are a free download. The task board is currently in beta but will have a licence fee when relesaed. <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Mostly excel. Otherwise Product Owners will complain <img src="/wiki/lib/images/smileys/icon_wink.gif" class="middle" alt=";-)" /> We also use TFS with the Scrum Template.  <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We use Scrum for Team System w/ the TaskBoard application for a scrum board feel and functionality. TaskBoard is in it&#039;s first release and has some kinks to work out, but if you&#039;re a Microsoft Team Foundation Server user and want to use the Scrum for Team System process template, I highly recommend using TaskBoard. <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you&#039;re lucky enough to have everyone co-located, I&#039;ve found the Whiteboards/stickypads/etc. work pretty well. But if you&#039;re trying to coordinate resources across multiple locations (which is the case in many shops), you really need a tool. If you&#039;re a TFS shop, I&#039;d recommend Scrum for TFS: I&#039;ve used it successfully, and I like the built-in ability that TFS gives you to move seamlessly from the TFS environment to Excel, Project, SharePoint, and so forth. <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>
