<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Agilefant is a web-based tool written on Java and the tool is under active development. It is quite feature rich and allows to create products, projects, iterations, themes and user stories, has time tracking, burn down chart, some people allocations management. It works pretty fast. The missing features are release and iteration planning. The tool does not have the concept of releases at all and that is strange, since it has products! Almost no reporting, and poor customization. It does not support points units for planning (quite strange for agile tool). User interface has too few screens and some screens looks overburdened (like default project screen which contains project details, themes, backlog, iterations with all details). There are some usability issues, but in general tool is quite easy to grasp. It does not look like a complicated solution. You may try Agilefant for small projects, I don&#039;t think it will be convenient for large projects with 20+ people. Pros : Products support and nice Product Roadmap chart, Quite easy to use, Time tracking, Allocations support. Cons : Points are missing, Lack of reporting, No releases/iteration planning, Poor customizability. <em>(agile-tools.net)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Overall I give high marks to Agilefant, IceScrum and Agilo. XPlanner has significant drawbacks but is a very capable tools the feature sets meet your needs. eXPlainPMT is missing too many key features and its development status is uncertain, so I donâ€™t recommend it. However, each organization should consider its own situation and feature needs before choosing a tool. Particular features may be very important for one organization but not for another. <em>(<a href="http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2009/comparing-open-source-agile-project-management-tools/" class="urlextern" title="http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2009/comparing-open-source-agile-project-management-tools/"  rel="nofollow">see the detailed review here</a>)</em></div>
