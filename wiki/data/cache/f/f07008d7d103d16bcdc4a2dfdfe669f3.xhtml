From that point on it&#039;s all physical - multiple jumbo whiteboards and lots of cards stuck on with tack. We&#039;re lucky to have the whole team colocated, and we like the social stuff that happens when you have a real board to gather around and physical story cards to move across it. And the perform the &#039;information radiator&#039; function very well, in my opinion, better than an online system would do. </div>
