<li class="level1"><div class="li">  I use Agilo -  <a href="http://www.agile42.com/cms/pages/agilo" class="urlextern" title="http://www.agile42.com/cms/pages/agilo"  rel="nofollow">http://www.agile42.com/cms/pages/agilo</a>   - and am quite happy with it. Very <strong>light</strong>, seamlessly <strong>integrating with lda</strong>p based authentication.  <em>(LinkedIn3)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="http://www.agile42.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.agile42.com"  rel="nofollow">www.agile42.com</a> has a pretty neat tool. Or you can install Trac from Edgewall and configure burndown plugin - takes more work though. (LinkedIn2)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Great Product and very helpful for the Scrum Process. I&#039;m using Agilo Pro for Scrum in an Open Source Project (<a href="http://www.oksimo.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.oksimo.org"  rel="nofollow">http://www.oksimo.org</a>) and also at the University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main, in research projects together with students, professors and laboratory engineers. The feedback from them is very positive. This tool supports excellent the Development Process of Scrum. Agilo for Scrum is well documented in the online help. It&#039;s easy to install and the administration interface is good, and almost everything can be configured to individual flavor. The extend functionality of the Pro Version (like the Whiteboard) are very helpful to understand the Scrum Process and working with the Sprint in the Sprint planning and daily scrums. The new tickets, like User Story, have reasonable properties and are very useful to describe an requirement in the Scrum Process. The Product and Sprint Backlogs has nice different views of the acual development state and a good overview to their tickets with good sorting possibilities. With these views, it is very easy to handle the project management process with Scrum. The Burndown Chart and other graphical outputs, which displays the development state are excellent, but I didn&#039;t found how to configure the dashboard and these views. During the complete setup, configuration and handling I hadn&#039;t any problems and found no bugs. A nice to have feature will be the export of tickets to csv files or a complete backup solution for a whole project. I didn&#039;t figure out how to delete a ticket, or why this feature is not implemented yet. Only delete tickets from csv files is supported. But if I have no export possibility that feature is not very usable for me. But I think these requirements are issues for trac. I have also experiences in working with other tools like Mingle from Thoughtworks, but finally I prefer to work with Agilo fro Scrum! Great commendation to the the agilo42 team! These acknowledgments goes also to the Trac development team, which do a great work to build the basic system for Agilo. Thanks a lot for that tool! <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I&#039;m using Agilo for both, a charity project (<a href="http://www.healthcare-it-africa.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.healthcare-it-africa.org"  rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcare-it-africa.org</a>) and for student projects. Agilo helps us to structure our projects very easily and trac progress. it is also perfect for teaching students the basics of agile development. It also is THE tool for everyone who has read the bood “Head First - Software Engineering”, since the white board is exactly reflecting the images in the book. It took me only a bit to install and figure out how to support multiple-projects. But now it works like a champ! <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Good comprehensive tool for remote agile teams. Highly recommended (especially the pro version, which includes the drag-and-drop whiteboard. Loved it!) The platform provides all the functionality you would expect from an online collaboration tool for agile development. The tool supports multiple backlogs each with multiple teams, provides a basis for online team collaboration, and delivers insight into the effectiveness of the agile delivery process through tracking changes across different development sprints, releases and even teams. Agilo has proven to be an excellent online tool for sharing information between remote scrum teams, and providing a single platform for coordinating multiple scrum teams across multiple locations. <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Good Product, minor issues. As I will be posting in my blog I had a little trouble with the installation, but it was trivial to fix once I found out what the trouble was. The documentation was a little lacking, from Trac and Agilo. Otherwise it worked find. Here&#039;s the link to the trouble I had, and fixes: <a href="http://specialbrands.net/2010/01/12/agilo-a-scrum-tool-agile-scrum/" class="urlextern" title="http://specialbrands.net/2010/01/12/agilo-a-scrum-tool-agile-scrum/"  rel="nofollow">http://specialbrands.net/2010/01/12/agilo-a-scrum-tool-agile-scrum/</a> (userstories.com)</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> We found this software by searching for a good Scrum tool for our project at university. Agilo for Scrum is easy to install and to setup teams, backlogs and the user permissions. It is necessary for our project to have the possibility to change the user story points. Another great feature is the nice Whiteboard. In conclusion, a great Scrum tool!<em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A Scrum tool how it should be. I liked to use the analog whiteboard, but since we are more teams those Scrum Tools are not supporting us enough. We found Agilo Pro with the interactive digital whitboard and we are really happy with it. Agilo supports Scrum in every detail and you can see that the guys from agile42 know agile and Scrum very well. <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Agilo Online Whiteboard - One of the best Scrum Tools. We are using Agilo for Scrum since 11 iterations with many distributed teams and projects. The new online whiteboard is supporting us perfectly during the sprint planning and the daily Scrums. Agilo is the best Scrum Tool we found on the market. <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Perfect for Off-shored teams. We&#039;ve been evaluating many scrum tools, but this one satisfies our needs perfectly. It&#039;s supporting both, the project management&#039;s issues as well as the developer team on a daily basis with it&#039;s integration to Subversion and Eclipse. We are using Agilo for off-shored teams and it keeps us in sync.<em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Very useful Tool. We have chosen agile42 to implement Scrum and have been very happy about the result. After we have known Scrum better, we made the decision to use the Scrum Tool Agilo for Scrum to support us on a daily basis. Agilo helps us to handle our backlogs, requirements, user stories and tasks. I can strongly recommend Agilo for Scrum. It supports all Scrum Roles and helps following the Scrum Process.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Great Product. The principles of scrum are easy - using scrum is not! You cannot preach daily visability of your progress without having the right tooling. This requires burndown charts on the one hand but this is not sufficient. The right user interface to motivate your team to use and update tasks/tickets is required. The effort to care for the tickets has to be minimal for acceptance reasons. This was the main reason for us to introduce Agilo and we are really happy with the result. <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The right tool for our Scrum teams. We use agilo for several months now and we really like it. Agilo provides the flexibility to adapt the tool to our process, not the other way round. There a lot of small things that make Agilo really useful: For example, the ideal burndown line decreases proportional to the capacity - if 1/2 of the team are on vacation in the next week, the ideal burndown won&#039;t decrease as fast as in the other weeks where the whole team is present. Also we can add our own ticket types+backlogs so that the Scrum Master can have his own impediment backlog. Installation was bit tricky previously but in the latest versions, it became way easier.<em>(userstories.com)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Great Tool To Explore the Ticketing system. Hi , I have been using agilo for the past 6 months. It has given more knowledge about the ticket system and agile methodology. The only one problem I have faced in this is issue in <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> browsers. Other wise its a great tool to work.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A very lean tool with a bit of spice and some rough corners to smooth, but really effective! Agilo is based on Trac, which alone as an extremely wide user base, and is one of the most used ticketing system in the agile community. Agilo adds to Trac a couple of significant improvement, that alone, without even considering the specific Scrum features are worth of a look: ticket typing, csv import and ticket linking. These three feature which deeply change the core usability of the tool, allowing to implement in a very easy and natural way, “just enough” structure on top of trac, to make it able to better support your way of working are extremely valuable. Moreover the new version of agilo 0.7 offer a set of very interesting feature specific to scrum, and still allow you to personalize almost everything, making it as lean as you like. The look &amp; feel has also greatly improved, even though there are still some rough edges, for example the ticket handling, still in the “traditional” trac way is not fitting anymore with the advanced and configurable backlog handling. I am confident that these aspects: inline ticket creation, better drag &amp; drop support, and other “intuitive” transformations will occur pretty soon, the tool as an active community (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/agilo" class="urlextern" title="http://groups.google.com/group/agilo"  rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/agilo</a>) where scrum related issues and features are discussed and supported by the development team, that collaborate intensively with everyone encountering problems in the tool installation and configuration. The tool offers some unique and handy features, that helps the team in better understanding what the status is (not only through the burndown chart) as well as speeding up some operation at specific Scrum cerimonies. As an example automatically calculating (on a set of well defined user stories and tasks, selectable by the team) the ratio of Story Points/Ideal Hours (Days) that gives the possibility to the team to have a quick check with the capacity set by individual team members and see if the initial commitment is fitting (more or less) in the team available hours. Well is a click instead of a lot of Excel work, and the results is reflected also in the burndown chart. The tool also stores metrics on the team performances, that help the team in monitoring its efficiency and historical data, and see the improvements. Very handy is also the Timeline view, that is enriched with informations related to Sprints and other specific Scrum cerimonies, that allows a very fast wrap up at the Retrospective, allowing the team to inspect &amp; adapt effectively. Thanks for the great tool <img src="/wiki/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="middle" alt=":-)" /><em>(userstories.com)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Experience applied. Agilo is a very handy tool for daily development needs. I found it useful through the entire life cycle of a product, from shaping the vision, to prioritizing requirements to creating work packages all the way down into issue tracking. The fact it is based on Trac helps in this aspect, there are a wealth of plugins to truly embed Agilo into your workflow. You can tell the developers have real-world experience. It is a proper “tool”, not an abstract project view aimed at managers. Highly recommended.<em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Scrum tool based on real project experiences. The Tool works great. It has all the features you need in a tool to support the Scrum process: - daily stand-up - burn down charts - product backlog - sprint backlog - etc. A nice and very useful feature is the ability to link items together. This bi-directional traceability allows you to create useful relations between requirements and user stories, user stories and task etc. You can see, that this tool is based on real scrum project experiences. <em>(userstories.com)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Agilo based on Trac. The tool is under active development (latest version July 26, 2008). While it has several nice features like timeline, burn down charts and dashboard, integrated wiki, the concept behind Agilo has several flaws. There are no projects in the system, it means if you have several projects you will have to implement a workaround. Iteration and Releases planning is cumbersome, it is not easy to figure out how to create an iteration plan. Still Agilo is a good free tool for agile development. Pros : Integrated Wiki, Good Burn Down Chart, Changes history (timeline), Saved search queries, Story can be split to tasks, Supports Stories, Bugs and Impediments. Cons : Not very usable user interface, No Projects, No planning UI, it is possible to reassign user stories from Edit screen only. People management not present in UI. <em>(agile-tools.net)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Overall I give high marks to Agilefant, IceScrum and Agilo. XPlanner has significant drawbacks but is a very capable tools the feature sets meet your needs. eXPlainPMT is missing too many key features and its development status is uncertain, so I don’t recommend it. However, each organization should consider its own situation and feature needs before choosing a tool. Particular features may be very important for one organization but not for another. <em>(<a href="http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2009/comparing-open-source-agile-project-management-tools/" class="urlextern" title="http://olex.openlogic.com/wazi/2009/comparing-open-source-agile-project-management-tools/"  rel="nofollow">see the detailed review here</a>)</em></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> AgileBuddy, ProjectCards and Agilo probably make up the next grouping and all focus on the backlog management areas of the process. They don&#039;t provide much, if anything, in the way of story and task boards or burndown charts.  <em>(<a href="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx" class="urlextern" title="http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx"  rel="nofollow">see the detailed review here</a>)</em></div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Have you tried Agilo for Scrum? <a href="http://www.agiloforscrum.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.agiloforscrum.org"  rel="nofollow">http://www.agiloforscrum.org</a> it is free and Open Source, it has a nice integration with SVN that speeds up a lot the usage from the development team perspective. It is based on Trac that is a very wide spread tool for Agile Project Management and adds nice charts and: - Sprint Backlog with automated Burndown Chart - Product Backlog with customizable sorting criteria, and types - Statistics Charts on Team Velocity, Commitment, Estimations - Integration with SVN and code browsing, very cool updating tickets through SVN comments - Drag &amp; Drop to manually reposition items in the backlogs - Import &amp; Export from CSV - Ticket linking and grouping for better traceability and organization. We like it a lot <img src="/wiki/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="middle" alt=":-)" /> It is rumored that a whiteboard and enterprise features will come soon, at least this is what appeared already a couple of times on the Agilo User Group (Google Groups). <em>(<a href="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760" class="urlextern" title="http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&amp;id=35760"  rel="nofollow">mobi</a>)</em></div>
