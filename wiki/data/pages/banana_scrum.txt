====== Banana Scrum ======

  -  I'm using Banana Scrum (  http://www.bananascrum.com  ) - why? Because it is simple and matches Scrum workflow perfectly. But don't take my word for it - after all I'm Banana Scrum's Product Owner - check it yourself.  
  - I believe Banana Scrum is worth looking at. It has some really nice features. You can try it out without registering. //([[http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&id=35760|mobi]])//
