====== Bright Green Projects ======
  - This is a GREAT tool and worth a try! I almost didn't evaluate BrightGreen, because it didn't have any previous feedback. I'm VERY GLAD I decided to give due diligence to my evaluation and took a look at BrightGreen. Once you get into this tool it's **very intuitive** and easy to understand. I was able to get up and running in minutes. They EXCEL at **support** and the live chat feature is phenomenal. The **product backlog and sprint planning** features are very intuitive and easy to navigate. I understand they're updating some of the charts and the wall. This tool is DEFINITELY worth checking out. (userstories.com)
