====== Agile Buddy ======

  - AgileBuddy, ProjectCards and Agilo probably make up the next grouping and all focus on the backlog management areas of the process. They don't provide much, if anything, in the way of story and task boards or burndown charts.   (edit : However, to clarify, Agilebuddy does contain a burndown chart in the app. There is also a screen cap of it on the Agilebuddy homepage named "Iteration Burndown")//([[http://consultingblogs.emc.com/gavyndowst/archive/2009/08/06/reviewing-agile-process-management-tools-part-2.aspx|see the detailed review here]])//
