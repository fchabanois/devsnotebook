====== TargetProcess ======

  - I have several years experience with targetprocess send me your questions, I find it to be the best. //(LinkedIn3)//
  - I've found TargetProcess to be a great balance of functionality without overhead. Even with a co-located team I still like to use a physical board as an information radiator. I'm always amazed out how much information and context can be projected from simple cards. Everyone from developers to senior execs can glance at the board/wall and get an instant feel for the project. //(LinkedIn3)//
  - We also use TargetProcess and find it to be practical, simple and functional. We bring up it's virtual "task board" during the daily standup, and host that on a GoToMeeting for the distributed guys. TP is simple to use, track time, and more importantly manage resources to meet a deadline. The only drawback is that it lacks the ability to treat bugs the same as you do with tasks as far as having a virtual "task board" that you can move items to the "done" column. //(LinkedIn3)//
  - Excellent, mais semble vouloir trop en faire sans le faire au complet. Les couleurs sont définitivement à revoir J //([[http://focusintelligence.ca/2009/06/01/top-outils-de-gestion-scrum/|focusintelligence.ca]])//
  - TargetProcess is a good tool, But if you are new to SCRUM, I recommend to use simplest tools first (whiteboard, sticky, etc.). It is important to focus on communication and process first. Then you may feel the need for software tool. //([[http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&id=35760|mobi]])//
  - We have used Target Process for around a year, and it's very good. You can buy the software outright, or you can use their hosted version - both work well and the price is reasonable. We used to use Rally, but everyone in development really hated it - it was slow, unintuitive, cumbersome, and in general not at all what we wanted although it was fairly pricey. After living with it for almost a year, we switched to TP, which is actually quite a good tool. The other good thing about TP is that the company behind it isn't as well known as VersionOne and Rally, and so are much more responsive to our needs than Rally ever was... //([[http://en.how-to.mobi/index.php?sd=fr&id=35760|mobi]])//
